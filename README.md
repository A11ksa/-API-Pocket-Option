## üìã Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** (recommended 3.9+)
- Google Chrome (for auto-login/recaptcha)
- All required packages in `requirements.txt`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/A11ksa/-API-Pocket-Option.git
cd -API-Pocket-Option
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install .

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Setup
1. Auto-Login and Session Handling
On first run, the library will launch Chrome via Selenium, login to Pocket Option, solve the CAPTCHA (if any), and extract the required SSID/session automatically.
Your credentials (email & password) are stored securely in sessions/config.json, and your session in sessions/session.json.

2. Manual SSID Setup (Advanced)
Alternatively, you may extract your session manually from your browser and place it in sessions/session.json.

3. Environment Variables & Settings
You may configure parameters in a .env file or via environment variables, such as:

PING_INTERVAL, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT, LOG_LEVEL, etc.

üßë‚Äçüíª Basic Usage Example

import asyncio
from api_pocket import AsyncPocketOptionClient, OrderDirection, get_ssid

async def main():
    # Automatically retrieve SSID (auto-login)
    ssid = get_ssid(email="your@email.com", password="your_password")["demo"]
    client = AsyncPocketOptionClient(ssid=ssid, is_demo=True)
    await client.connect()

    balance = await client.get_balance()
    print(f"Balance: {balance.balance} {balance.currency}")

    # List assets & payouts
    assets = await client.get_available_assets()
    for k, v in assets.items():
        print(k, "payout:", v['payout'], "is_open:", v['is_open'])

    # Place an order (10$ CALL on EURUSD_otc for 1min)
    order = await client.place_order(
        asset="EURUSD_otc",
        amount=10,
        direction=OrderDirection.CALL,
        duration=60
    )
    print("Order placed:", order.order_id)

    # Wait for result (no arbitrary timeout!)
    result = await client.check_win(order.order_id)
    print("Trade finished:", result)

    await client.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

ü§ñ Advanced Usage: Custom Strategies
You can build a fully automated bot by integrating this client into your strategy logic.
Example: Follow a signal source and auto-place trades:

async def run_signal_bot(signal_queue):
    ssid = get_ssid(email="...")["demo"]
    client = AsyncPocketOptionClient(ssid=ssid, is_demo=True)
    await client.connect()
    while True:
        signal = await signal_queue.get()  # Get signal from Telegram, file, etc.
        order = await client.place_order(
            asset=signal['asset'],
            amount=signal['amount'],
            direction=OrderDirection.CALL if signal['type'] == "CALL" else OrderDirection.PUT,
            duration=signal['duration']
        )
        print(f"Trade executed: {order.asset} | {order.direction}")
        result = await client.check_win(order.order_id)
        print("Result:", result)

You can subscribe to real-time candle/tick data for AI/ML strategies as well.

üîí Session & SSID Management
First login: Auto-extracts and saves session (with CAPTCHA handling).

Subsequent runs: Uses saved session unless expired.

Supports both demo and live accounts.

All data stored in /sessions/ for security and persistence.

üìù Logging & Monitoring
All operations and errors are logged to daily files via Loguru.

Health and error monitoring for debugging and stability.

You can control the logging level and output via environment variables.

üß™ Testing
The included test4.py script demonstrates all basic features and can be used to verify correct installation.

bash
ŸÜÿ≥ÿÆ
ÿ™ÿ≠ÿ±Ÿäÿ±
python test4.py
‚ùì Troubleshooting
Chrome not launching / SSID extraction fails:

Make sure Google Chrome is installed and up-to-date.

Ensure chromedriver matches your Chrome version (handled by webdriver-manager).

If CAPTCHA solving fails, complete it manually in the opened browser.

WebSocket connection errors:

Check your internet/firewall settings.

If persistent, try changing WebSocket region in the config.

API errors / trade not executed:

Make sure account has enough balance.

Check if the asset is open and available for trading.
